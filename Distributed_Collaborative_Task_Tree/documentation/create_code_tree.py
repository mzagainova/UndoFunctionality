# FIRST RUN THROUGH:
# Set up a script to go through all the files in each
 # repo and create a graph of them to know which files are in which place





# FINAL RUN THROUGH:
# Set up a script to go through all the files in each
 # repo and look for function calls and create a graph of 
  # the calls to know which files associate with which other
   # files so have a full working outline of how the system fits together
